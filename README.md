# About
I am a Junior at Whitman College, pursuing a degree in computer science with a strong passion for software development. I enjoy the process of continuous learning, research, collaboration, and experimentation. Recently, I've been focusing on data analytics, recognizing the vital role it plays in helping businesses make informed decisions and take action.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I've played tennis throughout my life, which has honed my skills in strategic thinking, discipline, and mental toughness. I'm currently seeking a summer 2025 internship where I can apply my skills, experience, and passion.

# Where's Schueller Project
During this project I aimed to find which fast food restaurants Professor Schueller preferred. We came to the conclusion Professor Schueller enjoys to eat Taqueria in Walla Walla the most.

Some possible issues with my analysis however is that I recorded instances in a nonoptimal way causing there to be way too many instances of certain spots including the Taqueria.
